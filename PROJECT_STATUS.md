### ‚ùå Remaining Tasks (20%)

#### üî¥ High Priority
1. **Configure Apache Beam pipeline for production**
   - Set up Google Cloud Pub/Sub or AWS Kinesis integration
   - Configure pipeline for 1M+ daily transaction throughput
   - Implement proper error handling and retry logic

2. **Optimize model to achieve 88% accuracy**
   - Current accuracy: 80.1% (need 8% improvement)
   - Try advanced architectures (Transformer, XGBoost ensemble)
   - Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna or similar
   - Feature engineering refinements

3. **Deploy infrastructure to AWS**
   - Run Terraform scripts to provision production environment
   - Configure environment variables and secrets
   - Set up proper VPC and security groups

4. **Load test for 2000+ concurrent users**
   - Stress test WebSocket server with tools like k6 or Locust
   - Implement connection pooling and optimization
   - Configure auto-scaling triggers based on load

#### üü° Medium Priority
5. **Database migration to RDS**
   - Migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL
   - Set up proper connection pooling
   - Implement database migrations with Alembic

6. **S3 model deployment**
   - Upload trained models to S3 bucket
   - Update server code to load models from S3
   - Implement model versioning

7. **Monitoring and alerting**
   - Configure CloudWatch for latency tracking
   - Set up alerts for performance degradation
   - Implement distributed tracing

#### üü¢ Low Priority
8. **CI/CD pipeline**
   - Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Configure automated deployments to ECS
   - Implement blue-green deployment strategy

## Performance Metrics to Achieve
- [ ] 1M+ daily transactions processing capability
- [ ] Sub-second latency for real-time updates
- [ ] 88% accuracy in purchase prediction
- [ ] Support for 2000+ concurrent WebSocket connections
- [ ] 99.9% uptime SLA

## Next Steps
1. Start with high-priority tasks focusing on model optimization
2. Set up a staging environment on AWS for testing
3. Conduct performance benchmarking before production deployment
4. Document API endpoints and deployment procedures

## Notes
- The core ML and application logic is complete
- Main focus should be on production-readiness and performance optimization
- Consider implementing A/B testing framework for model improvements
